# password-generator

In this assignment we learned how to get some information from users and apply it to something
we also learned how to randomize something
we learned how to do loops 
we've learned several ways to declare something
how to change that thing, how to rename that thing
all in all this is very confusing
if I was going to spend more time on this assignment i likely would have added a condition that if you didn't select a certain amount of character options that you would have to 
start again and select the minimum amount of character options, similar to the condition added about length.

### deployment and usage

 click the link provided
 select the generate button, when prompt window appears select the character sets you'd like to include
 once finished with selections your auto generated randomized password will appear
